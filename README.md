# Simpel web browser
A simple web browser using .NET Windows Forms. 

One of my educational projects of the first course of "Applied Computer Science" at the university.

The main idea here is to implement the work with the config file, which should remember the position and size of the window, as well as the last open URL.

## How to use
Run Browser.exe.
